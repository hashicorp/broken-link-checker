# Broken Link Checker

A wrapper around [muffet](https://github.com/raviqqe/muffet) to automate broken link checking for HashiCorp properties.

An older repository [hashicorp/gh-action-check-broken-links](https://github.com/hashicorp/gh-action-check-broken-links) exists as a past attempt at solving this problem.
